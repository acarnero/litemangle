==========

Light-weight library for some Mangle routines.


A C++ class and simple Python code to read and look up quantities in
Mangle masks.  The C++ code is provided as a "header only library" for
convenience and because the code is relatively light-weight.
If compilation time becomes an issue, the main methods can be easily
defined in a .cpp file, a Makefile etc.

The Mangle package is available at:
http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/mangle/   or
http://space.mit.edu/~molly/mangle/
and the algorithms are described in a series of papers including
Swanson et al. (2008; MNRAS, 387, 1391).
